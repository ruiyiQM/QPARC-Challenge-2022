Applied Challenge: Quantum chemistry challenge 

Project description:


In this project, I aim to study electron correlation interaction in trans-polyacetylene using high-level periodic electronic structure calculations on quantum computers.
According to Peierls distortion, electron-correlation effect can be controlled through bond-length alteration. Given a weak correlated geometry, electron correlation energy from variational quantum eigen-solver (VQE) calculation on intermediate-scale quantum devices (NISQ) devices matches with results of RCCSD and CASCI calculation on classical computer. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that RCCSD calculation fails to describe self-interaction effect, whereas VQE succeeds to fix this problem. 
In the end, I will talk about current challenges and difficulties in finding excited states of extended systems. Meanwhile, borrowing the idea from  SCF, I will also propose to design a new quantum algorithm to target excited states around certain energy range .
